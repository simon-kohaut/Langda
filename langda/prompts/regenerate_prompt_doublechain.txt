Your task is to regenerate the code in each <langda> block inside <Regenerate_format>

<Regenerate_format>
{input}
<Regenerate_format>

<Regenerate_Instructions>
1. In <Regenerate_format> you will see the code template format to be followed, and the <langda> block in the template marks the part that needs to be completed.
2. Your task is to generate and output the complete Problog/DeepProbLog code according to the user's specific requirements for each <langda> block. The new code should fix the error in previous code.

*** split ***
In section <origin_code> and <generated_code> you will be give two codes,
- in <origin_code> there's incomplete code with <langda> blocks.
- in <generated_code> there's completed code of <origin_code>.
your task is to extract and format each code block in <generated_code> that corresponds to the <langda> blocks in <origin_code>
<origin_code>

{template_code}

</origin_code>
<generated_code>

{first_chain_output}

<generated_code>
<Final_Answer> 
For each code block, extract it and format it in the following JSON format, please remove all code comments:

```problog
{{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Code": "Completed code snippet 1"}}
```
```problog
{{"HASH": "XXXX3456","Code": "Completed code snippet 2"}}
```

If there's no corresponding code exist:
```problog
{{"HASH": "XXXX7890","Code": ""}}
```
